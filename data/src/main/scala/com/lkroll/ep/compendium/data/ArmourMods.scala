It acts as an outer immune system designed to neutralize toxic agents and nanotoxins with which it comes into contact. This provides immunity to drugs, toxins, and nanotoxins applied dermally, such as with a slap patch or splash grenade. It has no effect on inhaled, oral, or injected drugs (including coated weapons).",

When an attack strikes the coating, it deto- nates to disrupt the attack. Bursts and full autofire are treated as a single attack. A reactive coating increases the Armor Value by +5/+5, but each detonation automatically inflicts 1 point of damage on the wearer. Reactive armor also works against melee attacks, but the attacker also suffers 1d10 ÷ 2 (round up) points of damage per attack (armor protects) from the microexplosion.
