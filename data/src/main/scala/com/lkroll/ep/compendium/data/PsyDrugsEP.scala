If they succeed, they suffer a –30 impairment on Psi skills and all strain is doubled. Inhibitor has an unfortunate side effect of doping the character down, however; apply a –10 modifier to their COG. Inhibitor-influenced characters tend to have a glazed, dopey expression and have difficulty getting excited or emotional.",

Each type of Psi-opener is customized for a particular sleight. While primarily intended for non-asyncs, non-asyncs may not possess Psi skills, so they must default to WIL. For this reason, Psi-Opener is often doubled up with Psike-out. Using Psi-opener is a mind-wrenching experience. Users are occasionally subject to hallucinations (gamemaster discretion).
