In order to create a safe zone for an encampment in an alien environment, gatecrashers may deploy a bio-defense unit (BDU). This device consists of an advanced nanotech hive that deploys a nanobot swarm over a small area, specifically designed to destroy and break down all life or other complex organic molecules that are alien or toxic/dangerous to transhumans. The nanobots produced by this unit have no effect on any Earth-derived life or on any safe compounds they produce. However, all known alien life possesses biochemistries that are highly distinctive and so a BDU can easily destroy all non-Earth life without risking any harm to gatecrashers or any pets, test animals, or biological compounds they bring with them from the solar system. The operator can also add specific alien life forms and compounds to the list of targets that the BDU will specifically not attack.\nThe BDU is a small 15cm hemisphere that contains the hive and a swarm of nanobots. When activated, the swarm deploys over an area 20m in diameter (or less if the operator desires). Users can combine multiple BDUs to clear larger areas. Within the designated area, the nanobots destroy and break down all alien life and remove every trace of alien biological activity, leaving behind only sterile soil, bare rock, and pure water. In addition to removing potential toxins, the BDU also clears an area of even the sturdiest alien plants that might interfere with setting up camp. Alien life that wanders into the protected area automatically suffers 1d10 ÷ 2 DV per Action Turn. If the creature has armor this will be eaten away first. This damage continues as long as the creature remains within the protected area. This process is sufficiently painful that almost all alien life swiftly flees the protected area.

To use this device, the operator places the four rods upright in a square or rectangle around the camp or other area that they wish to protect. Each rod can be as far as 30m from the two nearest rods. Additional defense beacon packs may be deployed to cover a larger perimeter. The operator then designates those individuals and devices that are allowed to freely cross the barrier created by these rods and also determines the minimum size of intruders that will be defended against and the level of defense. Once in place, defense beacons warn everyone inside the camp, using either speakers or radio, of any intruders either coming within 30m or attempting to cross the invisible fence created by the four rods. Also, defense beacons can be programmed to use the stunners or microwave agonizers against any intruders (they have Beam Weapons skill 40).

This suit covers the entire body in a climate-controlled garment with an outer surface that reflects all microwaves and radio waves (meaning they are +10 to detect with radar). The suit is lined with a superconductive charged wire mesh, effectively cocooning the user in a bubble from which they can neither send nor receive radio signals. This cuts the wearer off from the mesh and other data sources, but also protects them from hacking attacks and mesh – or radio-based basilisk hacks.\nIn addition, the suit’s helmet is opaque on the exterior and soundproofed, preventing the viewer from seeing out in the normal and near-visual spectrums or hearing noises around them. The helmet is mounted with an external camera (visual and infrared) and microphone, however, that feed input inside the helmet (though still outside the Faraday mesh). The helmet’s built-in speaker and screen are designed to deliberately degrade information they display/emit, however, to impede potential hostile sensory inputs (+30 to tests to resist basilisk hacks). As a result, while wearing this suit, all sounds are somewhat distorted and vision is fuzzy and indistinct. While these limitations can be problematic, they also render the wearer immune (or at least resistant) to all known forms of incapacitating or mentally affecting inputs.\nAll Faraday suits include radio links so that other team members can communicate with the wearer. However, these radios cannot be connected to the wearer’s basic implants. Instead, the wearer must use the deliberately low-grade microphone and speakers in the helmet to communicate with others. An actual old-fashioned keyboard mounted on the suit’s arm enables text messages in case audio signals are too degraded or full radio considered too dangerous. These measures minimize the chance that if one member of a team is affected by incapacitating inputs, they will be able to spread the memetic infection to the rest of the team.\nThe helmets of Faraday suits are designed to retract into a barely noticeable collar. They can go from this state to a fully activated helmet within 1 Action Turn. Except in obviously dangerous situations, most users wear the helmets open, thus permitting them to use basic implants and ectos normally. Many users instruct their muse to automatically activate the helmet if they detect any potentially dangerous inputs to protect the wearer.",

Since gatecrashers can rarely afford to either wait several days to heal or to carry around a comrade in medical stasis, a disposable healing pod was developed. This small-sized device contains a wide variety of advanced medical repair and life support nanotechnology.\nTo use this device, the patient must either be in a functional vacsuit or the healing pod must be connected to a Life-Support Pack (p. 159) and the patient placed into a morph-sized sack that is included with the device. When the healing pod is activated, the unit’s compressed nanobots swarm out, envelop the patient, and thoroughly infiltrate their body.
