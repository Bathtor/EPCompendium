Whatever the circumstances, the character should occasionally be obligated to meet or avoid the needs and demands of the ships’ rightful owners, its passengers, and its crew. For example, the character may have salvaged a derelict vessel and converted it into a refugee barge during the Fall, but must now deal with the scum squatters that have effectively taken it over. Operating a ship also comes with a host of logistical issues, from acquiring reaction mass to making deals for passengers and cargo to somehow funding an inexhaustible list of critical repairs. Keeping the ship operational could become a campaign unto itself.",
