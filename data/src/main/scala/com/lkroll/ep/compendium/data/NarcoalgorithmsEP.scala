These inputs are spliced together, their emotional inputs amplified, and then the entire package is spiked with some hormonal circuit triggers and artificial synaesthesia. The effect is a mind-blowing mixed sampling of people’s lives, mashed together in a sensory soup, that hits the mind with a euphoric rush. Linkstate users are catatonic while under the effects (typical sessions run 3–4 hours), but afterwards they often report that they have flashbacks of events in other people’s lives. ",
